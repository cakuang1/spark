# Chapter by Chapter of Learning Spark 2nd Edition Summary

I am creating this to teach myself more about spark and master spark concepts. This will also provide a fairly in-depth overview for those who don't want to read the entire textbook. There will also be coding examples done on databricks notebooks for each chapter.
